# Week 6

### Title: Huffman encoding

### Problem statement

- Implement Huffman coding / decoding (it uses priority queue and binary search trees):
  - Do it as a real project, combine what you have learned so far
  - One binary (Ruby script) with command line attributes to specify input/output files and mode (encode/decode)
  - Display help
  - Add automatic tests
  - Add documentation (README.md)
  - Do manual testing with some big files, verify encoding and decoding producing the original work
  - Try to benchmark the code (benchmark-ips, stackprof, tracking object allocations etc) and try to optimize it
